    "##NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model. The main types are document, key-value, wide-column, and graph. \n",
    "##They provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of data and high user loads.\n",
    "##Types of NOSQL databases: Document-based, Key-valued, Graph oriented and Column-based databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "##NoSQL document databases expand on the basic idea of key-value stores where ‘documents’ contain data and \n",
    "##each document is assigned a unique key, which is used to retrieve the document. \n",
    "##These are designed for storing, retrieving and managing document-oriented information, often stored as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). Unlike RDBMSs, \n",
    "##which require a static schema, document databases have a flexible schema as defined by the document contents.\n",

    "##MONGODB:: One of the most commonly used open source NoSQL document databases is MongoDB. \n",
    "##MongoDB is sometimes referred to as a ‘schemaless’ database as it does not enforce a particular structure on documents in a collection.\n",
    "##MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents that allow the data structure to be changed over time. If a new field needs to be added, \n",
    "##it can be added without affecting all other documents in the collection and without taking the database offline\n",
